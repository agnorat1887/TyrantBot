@everyone
WELCOME TO THE TRUE TYRANTS DISCORD SERVER.

The bot is the second hand to the TRUE TYRANT
As with all TYRANTS whatever the TYRANT says goes and all rules are subject to the TYRANTS interpretation/feelings
The TRUE TYRANT and ███ █████████ can send as many messages as they would like, with the rest of the total messages being distributed to the plebs.
The amount of messages that can be sent daily is 20 and only the TRUE TYRANT can add or remove messages using his infinite supply based on how the TRUE TYRANT sees fit
The only command that the peasants have access to is ?reserve, which will show how many messages we have in reserve and DOES NOT count towards the days total messages
Any attempts at a coup will result in swift punishment.
In order to keep the spirits up we will have be  having events throughout the week.
