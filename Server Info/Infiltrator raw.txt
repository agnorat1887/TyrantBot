@everyone Alert comrades! Our glorious homeland is being invaded and we must protect it at all costs!
These insurgents are being swapped around daily and could be any one of us!
If anyone has any information leading to the capture and purging of this insurgent then we will all be given a choice of award!
If the insurgent gets caught, then that comrade will be placed in the GULAG for a day and all messages will be silenced until he is released the next day
The insurgent can be caught when the TYRANT receives a majority vote on who they think the traitor is or if they are kicked for any reason

Notes for the insurgent:
The ONLY extra BOT command that the insurgent gets is ?add x. where x is any number.
You have full admin rights and can do whatever you please, weather that is a good or bad is up to you
Note that the larger the number for x, the more likely they are to get caught and removed for the rest of the day
For example ?add 8 has about a 50% to be successful and a 50% for the person to be caught. There are no warning or re-dos
If the insurgent gets destroyed at any point of their day, they will NOT be able to join back until the next day when someone else has access
